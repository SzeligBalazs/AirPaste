# AirPaste

## Hello! 👋

My name is Balázs Szélig. I am 14 years old and I love coding.
I'm currently working on a project, called AirPaste.
AirPaste helps you to transfer text between your devices. The application makes it quick and easy.
A WebSocket server runs in the background and the client(s) listen on the other devices. 
I'm developing it with Flutter and I'm planning to publish to Web, Android and Windows platforms.

### Sending mode
You can enter text to the input field. Then after pressing the send button the message will be sent.

### Receive mode
In receive mode, you can get messages from the WebSocket server.
The message is automatically copied to the clipboard.

### Short summary
The app creates a quick communication channel that allows you to send or receive messages between your devices.
